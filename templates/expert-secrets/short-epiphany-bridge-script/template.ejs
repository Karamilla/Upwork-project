<p>SHORT Epiphany Bridge ScriptThere I was, a <%= data.field1 %> trying to <%= data.field2 %>.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>The thing is, at the time I was <%= data.field3 %>.</p>
<br>
<p>The big problem was that <%= data.field4 %>. That meant <%= data.field5 %>, which <%= data.field6 %>.</p>
<br>
<p>Then, as if by chance, something amazing happened...</p>
<br>
<p>I <%= data.field7 %> about <%= data.field8 %>!</p>
<br>
<p>Instantly it became crystal clear to me how to <%= data.field9 %>, because I saw <%= data.field10 %>.</p>
<br>
<p>My plan was to start <%= data.field11 %>.</p>
<br>
<p>So I started <%= data.field12 %>. But we didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<br>
<p>We then <%= data.field13 %>.</p>
<br>
<p>After that, we <%= data.field14 %>.</p>
<br>
<p>Building on that success, we decided to <%= data.field15 %>.</p>
<br>
<p>We call it &ldquo;<%= data.field16 %>&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>With <%= data.field16 %> I can now <%= data.field17 %>!</p>
<br>
<p>And that&#39;s why I&#39;m so excited to share this with you so you can get these types of results too!</p>
